 *      This source file contains functions to use for testing the hardware connections of the differential drive on Tiva boards.
 *      Run the functions one by one keeping the main with nothing except this function. (not while loop) You can comment out the codes from main.
 *         "SysCtlClockSet(SYSCTL_SYSDIV_5|SYSCTL_USE_PLL|SYSCTL_XTAL_16MHZ|SYSCTL_OSC_MAIN);
			uart0Init();
			maxPWM = SysCtlClockGet()/(PWMfrequency*64);" DO NOT COMMENT THESE STARTING THREE LINES OF MAIN
 *
 *      Change the pins as per required or change the macro configurations from "init.h" file in "userLib" folder.
 *      Once the directions and polarities and connections are checked, proceed with the tuning using the actual main.c
